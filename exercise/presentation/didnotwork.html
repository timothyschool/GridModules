        <h1>WE ARE SORRY:(</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">We wanted to show the annoyance but also the entertainment side of commercial for free room in our mail accounts. The classic DVD logo animation, where the logo bounces from the sides of the screen was the inspiration for our visual concept. The
            DVD animation is on the other side very entertaining but also annoying. For our website we wanted to replace the DVD logo with images of the rooms we receive through our school mail account. Every time the images hits the edge of the screen,
            the flat picture should change. This animation should run over a screenshot of our mail account. This should show how it could be annoyance, when you are trying to navigate through your email, but should also show the entertaining part of
            watching the animation. Sadly our JavaScript knowledge was very limited that’s why we weren’t able to change the background image into the screenshot image. This is why our website isn’t finished.</p>
