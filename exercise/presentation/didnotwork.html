            <h1>Concept </h1>
            <p style="font-size: 25px; ">We wanted to show the annoying but also the entertaining side of commercials we get for free rooms in our mail accounts. The classic DVD logo animation, where the logo bounces of off the sides of the screen was the inspiration for our visual
                concept. The DVD animation is on the one side very entertaining but on the other side also annoying. For our website we wanted to replace the DVD logo with images of the rooms we received through our school mail account. Every time the
                images hits the edge of the screen, the flat picture should change. This animation should run over a screenshot of our mail account. This should show how it could be an annoyance, when you are trying to navigate through your email, but
                should also show the entertaining side of getting free room Pictures </p>

                It should also be a bit of a ADD (attention deficit disorder) Simmulator, which Tim is affected by. It should show how hard it can be trying to get the important information from the school email account, when there are a lot of distracting information
                floating around. So that should be our connection to our data self portrait. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 25px; ">
                Sadly our JavaScript knowledge was very limited that’s why we weren’t able to change the background image to the screenshot of our mailbox account at first. but with the help of hanna we were able to finish the Project as we imagined
